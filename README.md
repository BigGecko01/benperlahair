## Philosophy

From the inception of the Benjaminperladothair Project, we have embraced the simplicity and the elegance of a Web 1.0 aesthetic. This site is not merely a webpage; it is an homage to a purer era of the internet, a time when form followed function with unyielding integrity. Truly, we are the future the world hopes to see.

In our relentless pursuit of this utopian purity, we eschew any modern fripperies that might dilute or contaminate our pristine, pristine vision. The following features, emblematic of the superfluous complexity of contemporary web design, shall never defile our creation:

- **A color picker:** An affront to the unadulterated palette that our carefully curated aesthetic demands.
- **An eraser:** A tool of revisionism, incompatible with the spontaneous working environment we hope to achieve.
- **An undo:** For we do not retreat; every action on this site is a statement, a commitment.
- **Anything that compromises our style:** To do so would be to betray the very soul of benjaminperla.hair, and such a sacrilege will not be entertained. The spirit of Ben wills as such.

The Benjaminperladothair project. Here, less is not merely more; it is everything.
